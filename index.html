	<p>The Princess & the Bodyguard discovered their true identity one cold day in New York.
		A gentleman approached them, looked them up and down, taking in all the fine details,
		including, importantly, that the Bodyguard was carrying a mandolin.
		He stopped - he paused - and said "You Princess, go there " as he motioned towards a yellow taxi.
		"You, Bodyguard, go with her".  And in that moment, the Princess & the Bodyguard knew their
		true identities.  A Princess was born - and the Bodyguard was given his mission to look after the Princess.</p>

	<p>...and together they were given their  mission to  move people through music - joy,
		laughter, reflction, tears; to feel love and life and everything it has to offer ... </p>
	<p>The Princess and the Bodyguard are very eclectic in their musical tastes, and play a broad variety of music including
		50s, 60s, 70s & 80s rock;
		celtic; and
		folk.

					of Newcastle in her teenage years. She also plays fiddle, whistle & mandolin.
					An accomplished songwriter, she continues the fine folk tradition of telling the significant s
					tories of our times through her original songs.

					there are often sparks coming off his fiddle in the jigs and reels.</p>

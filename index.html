	<p class="first-para">The Princess & the Bodyguard discovered their true identity one cold day in New York.
		A gentleman approached them, looked them up and down, taking in all the fine details,
		including, importantly, that the Bodyguard was carrying a mandolin.
		He stopped - he paused - and said "You Princess, go there " as he motioned towards a yellow taxi.
		"You, Bodyguard, go with her".  And in that moment, the Princess & the Bodyguard knew their
		true identities.  A Princess was born - and the Bodyguard was given his mission to look after the Princess.</p>

	<p>...and together they were given their  mission to  move people through music - joy,
		laughter, reflection, tears: to feel love and life and everything it has to offer ... </p>
	<p>The Princess and the Bodyguard are very eclectic in their musical tastes, and play a broad variety of music including
		50s, 60s, 70s & 80s pop & rock;
		celtic; and
		folk.

					The Princess started playing piano when she was 6, guitar when she was 7, and won voice scholarships to the Conservatorium
					of Newcastle in her teenage years. She also plays fiddle, whistle & mandolin.
					An accomplished songwriter, she continues the fine tradition of telling the significant s
					tories through her original songs.

				<p class="grid">Despite being a Princess, she has performed at pubs, clubs and festivals,
				including Illawarra Folk Festival,Kangaroo Valley Folk Festival Gundagai Turning Wave Festival,

					there are often sparks coming off his fiddle in the jigs and reels.</p>
